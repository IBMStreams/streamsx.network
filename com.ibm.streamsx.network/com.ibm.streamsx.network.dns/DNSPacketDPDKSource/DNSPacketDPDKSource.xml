DNSPacketDPDKSource is an operator for the IBM Streams product that
receives network packets from a supported ethernet adapter. The operator function and structure are
similar to the 
[tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/op$com.ibm.streamsx.network.source$PacketLiveSource.html|PacketLiveSource]
and 
[tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/op$com.ibm.streamsx.network.parse$DNSMessageParser.html|DNSMessageParser]
operators;
see the documentation for those for details
of common functions and general background.  
The primary difference between
these related operators is that DNSPacketDPDKSource leverages 
the [http://www.dpdk.org|data plane development kit (DPDK)]
for higher performance.

DPDK supports a variety of [http://www.dpdk.org/doc/nics|ethernet adapters]. 
The PacketDPDKSource operator has been tested with these adapters:

* Mellanox ConnectX-3
* Mellanox ConnectX-3 Pro
* Intel e1000
* Intel I350

DPDK stores network packets received by a supported ethernet adapter in memory that is 
directly accessible by the DNSPacketDPDKSource operator, bypassing the Linux kernel.
This reduces overhead and allows the PacketDPDKSource operator to ingest packets
at a higher rate than the PacketLiveSource operator. 
The DNSPacketDPDKSource operator requires a dedicated processor core,
which must be specified explicitly, and which runs at 100% CPU utilization.

Output filters and attribute assignments are SPL expressions. They may use any
of the built-in SPL functions, and any of these functions:

* [tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/fc$com.ibm.streamsx.network.dns.html|network header parser result functions]

The DNSPacketDPDKSource operator can be configured to step quietly over 'jmirror' headers prepended to packets
by Juniper Networks 'mirror encapsulation'.

This operator is part of the network toolkit. To use it in an
application, include this statement in the SPL source file:

    use com.ibm.streamsx.network.dns::*;


# parallelization

DPDK can distribute network packets received by one ethernet adapter 
across multiple DNSPacketDPDKSource operators. 
This can increase an application's packet rate by parallelizing its analytics.
Note that each DNSPacketDPDKSource operator requires a separate processor core,
which runs at 100% CPU utiliziation.

DPDK requires that the total number of DNSPacketDPDKSource operators be a power of 2,
that is, the total number of DNSPacketDPDKSource operators must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.
Packets received by the network adapter will be distributed across all of the operators,
which will run in parallel. 
Packets are distributed according to a hash of their source and destination addresses and ports,
so request and response packets that belong to the same TCP transaction are all sent to 
the same operator.


# promiscuous mode

Ethernet adapters normally ignore packets that are not addressed to them.
However, when 'promiscious' mode is enabled, and adapter can
capture all network packets on its ethernet segment, even those that are not
addressed to it.  This is sometimes referred to as &quot;network sniffing&quot;.  
However, ethernet switches normally send only packets that are
addressed to the adapter; 'promiscious' mode is useful only when a switch has been
specifically configured to send packets that are not
addressed to the adapter. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;mirroring&quot;.

The DNSPacketDPDKSource operator will enable 'promiscuous' mode 
when its 'promiscous' parameter is set to `true`.


# setup for DPDK

The DPDK library requires some setup that is specific to the hardware and software configuration
of your machine. The documentation for the 
[tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/op$com.ibm.streamsx.network.source$PacketDPDKSource.html|PacketDPDKSource] operator offers guidelines for this setup, 
and examples for an
Intel processor with a Mellanox ethernet adapter. You will need to adapt the guidelines to match
your configuration.

    <parameter>
      <name>lcoreMaster</name>
      <description>

This optional parameter specifies a logical processor core for the DPDK master thread. 
This thread is not used for receiving packets, and does not have high CPU utiliztion.
If the machine has more than one NUMA node, specify a core on a node that does not
have the ethernet adapter connected to it. 

When multiple PacketDPDKSource operators are configured for the same ethernet adapter,
all operators must specify the same value with their 'lcoreMaster' parameters.

To determine how many processor cores your machine has, and which cores are connected to 
which NUMA nodes, execute the `lscpu` command at a Linux prompt.

    <parameter>
      <name>lcore</name>
      <description>

This required parameter specifies a logical processor core for the DPDK packet receive thread.
The core specified must belong to the NUMA node the ethernet adapter is connected to.
The receive thread will run the specified core at 100% CPU utilization.

If multiple PacketDPDKSource operators are configured for the same ethernet adapter,
each operator must specify a different value with its 'lcoreMaster' parameter. 
The total number of PacketDPDKSource operators must be a power of 2,
that is, the total number of PacketDPDKSource operators must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.
Packets received by the network adapter will be distributed across all of the operators,
which will run in parallel.

To determine how many processor cores your machine has, and which cores are connected to 
which NUMA nodes, execute the `lscpu` command at a Linux prompt. 
To determine which NUMA node your ethernet adapter is connected to, look in the file
'/sys/class/net/$DPDK_INTERFACE/device/numa_node'.

    <parameter>
      <name>nicPort</name>
      <description>

This optional parameter specifies which port of the ethernet adapter 
the operator will receive network packets from.
This applies only to adapters with multiple ports. 

The default value is '0' if this parameter is not specified.

    <parameter>
      <name>nicQueue</name>
      <description>

This optional parameter specifies which queue of received packets the operator will receive.
This applies only when multiple PacketDPDKSource operators are configured for the same ethernet adapter.
The value must be between 0 and 'N-1', where N is the total number of operators,
and each operator must specify a different queue, so that all queues are connected to an operator.

Note that DPDK requires the total number of queues and operators be a power of 2, that is,
the total number of queues and operators must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.
DPDK will distribute packets across all of the queues, and therefore across all of the operators.

The default value is '0' if this parameter is not specified.

    <parameter>
      <name>buffersizes</name>
      <description>

This optional parameter specifies how much buffer space, in megabytes, 
to allocate from available 2MB Linux 'hugepages' for each NUMA node,
specified as a string containing comma-separated values. 
For the NUMA node the ethernet adapter is connected to, specify an even number of megabytes.
For other NUMA nodes, if any, specify zero.

For example, on a machine with one NUMA node,
specify "100" to allocate 100 megabytes of buffer space.
For another example, on a machine with two NUMA nodes, 
where the ethernet adapter is connected to the second node,
specify "0,100" to allocate 100 megabytes of buffer space on the second NUMA node.
If multiple PacketDPDKSource operators are configured for the same network adapter, 
all operators should specify the same values for their 'buffersizes' parameter.

To determine which NUMA node your ethernet adapter is connected to, enter the command
`cat /sys/class/net/$DPDK_INTERFACE/device/numa_node` at a Linux prompt.
To determine how much buffer space is available in the 'hugepages' for that NUMA node,
enter the command
`grep -i -h hugepages /sys/devices/system/node/node\*/meminfo`
at a Linux prompt.

If this parameter is not specified, 
DPDK will allocate all available 2MB Linux 'hugepages' for its buffer space.

    <parameter>
      <name>outputFilters</name>
      <description>

This optional parameter takes a list of SPL expressions that specify which packets
should be emitted by the corresponding output port. The number of
expressions in the list must match the number of output ports, and each
expression must evaluate to a `boolean` value.  The output filter expressions may include any
of the
[tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/fc$com.ibm.streamsx.network.dns.html|network header parser result functions].

This optional parameter takes an expression of type
`float64` that specifies the interval, in seconds, for sending operator
metrics to the Streams runtime. If the value is zero or less, the operator
will not report metrics to the runtime, and the output assigment functions
for `libpcap` statistics will be zero.

The DNSPacketDPDKSource operator requires one or more output ports:

Each output port will produce one output tuple for each packet received
if the corresponding expression in the `outputFilters` parameter evaluates `true`,
or if no `outputFilters` parameter is specified.

Output attributes can be assigned values with any SPL expression that evaluates
to the proper type, and the expressions may include any of the
[tk$com.ibm.streamsx.network/fc$com.ibm.streamsx.network.source.html|network header parser result functions].
Output attributes that match input attributes in name and
type are copied automatically.
