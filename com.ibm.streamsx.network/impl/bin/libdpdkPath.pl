This script is called by the Streams compiler (that is, the 'sc' command) when
it compiles a PacketDPDKSource operator.  The compiler passes one of these
arguments to the script:

  includePath -- The compiler requests the directory path for the 'pam.h' file.

  libPath -- The compiler requests the directory path for the 'iss-pam1.so' file.

  lib -- The compiler requests the name of the library, which is 'iss-pam'.

The script responds by writing either the requested directory or an empty line
to STDOUT, depending upon the presence or absence of this environment variable:

  * If the environment variable $env is defined, and the directory it points to
    exists, and the directory contains the requested files, then that directory
    is written to STDOUT.
