# streamsx.network

The [Network toolkit for IBM Streams](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/) enables SPL applications to process low-level network traffic. It includes operators and functions that can:

- ingest raw ethernet packets from live network interfaces and recordings of network traffic

- parse DHCP, DNS, Netflow, and IPFIX messages

- reassemble application-level files from network packets

- map IP addresses into city, state, and country locations

- convert IP addresses betweeen binary and string representations

This version of the toolkit is intended for use with IBM Streams release 4.1 and later.

For the toolkit's documentation, please see [http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/doc/spldoc/html/](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/doc/spldoc/html/).
