# streamsx.network

The [Network toolkit for IBM Streams](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/) enables SPL applications to process low-level network traffic. It includes operators and functions that can:

- ingest raw ethernet packets from live network interfaces and recordings of network traffic

- parse DHCP, DNS, Netflow, and IPFIX messages

- reassemble application-level files from network packets

- map IP addresses into city, state, and country locations

- convert IP addresses betweeen binary and string representations

This version of the toolkit is intended for use with IBM Streams release 4.1 and later.

This toolkit implements the NLS feature. Use the guidelines for the message bundle that are described in 
[Messages and National Language Support for toolkits](https://github.com/IBMStreams/administration/wiki/Messages-and-National-Language-Support-for-toolkits)
